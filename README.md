AI Powered Automated Order Management System

This project is an end-to-end automated e-commerce workflow built to manage product orders, customer data, and shipment processes without human intervention.
From form submission to backend processing, every step is executed through AI-driven automation, ensuring speed, accuracy, and operational consistency.

How the System Works
1. Customer Places an Order

A customer submits an order using an online form.

The submitted data instantly enters the automation pipeline.

2. Real-Time Data Processing

All order details (name, phone, address, product, quantity, price) are automatically validated and structured.

Any missing or incorrect data triggers automated correction or follow-up actions.

3. Automated Storage in Database

The system stores every order into a Firestore database through an automated backend API service.

No manual entry or human interaction required.

4. Intelligent Order Status Updates

Order status (pending, confirmed, shipped, delivered, canceled) updates automatically based on predefined triggers.

Notifications can be sent to customers through WhatsApp, email or SMS.

5. Dashboard Integration

A dynamic admin dashboard displays all orders in real time:

New orders

Order history

Delivery status

Customer info

Revenue tracking

Everything refreshes automatically.
